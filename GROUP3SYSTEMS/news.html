                <h1>How Alabama's shocking loss to Vanderbilt impacts SEC, playoff and Kalen DeBoer </h1>
                <p>
                  
                    Vanderbilt stunned No. 1 Alabama 40-35 in an all-time upset that shakes up the SEC, College Football Playoff race and the outlook for Alabama first-year coach Kalen DeBoer.
It is the most unexpected result of the 2024 college football season. The Commodores were 0-60 against top-five teams before pulling off an upset that will knock the Crimson Tide down the rankings and the SEC pecking order. What about the 12-team College Football Playoff? That is a more-complicated question. </p>

                        <p>
                            What we're covering
• Hezbollah has lost contact with Hashem Safieddine, a possible successor to its late leader Hassan Nasrallah, according to a Lebanese security source. An Israeli strike targeted Safieddine on Friday.

• Israel carried out fresh airstrikes Saturday on the Lebanese capital’s southern suburbs, a Hezbollah stronghold that has seen daily attacks as part of an extensive Israeli bombing campaign. More than 1,400 people have died and over 1 million have been displaced in Lebanon, according to the Lebanese health ministry.

                        <h1>George ready for “hometown” NBA debut.</h1>
                        <p>
                           Kyshawn George was raised in Switzerland so he never expected he’d get to play an NBA game in front of a “hometown” crowd.


But because his Washington Wizards are starting the pre-season against the Toronto Raptors on Sunday in Montreal, where his dad was raised, he’s getting that chance.

“I never thought about it,” said George after a lengthy practice on Friday. “I didn’t even know that it was a possibility that existed.

“But yeah, I’m blessed that I have the opportunity to do that.”

                        <p>
                            
                        How does the idea of doing nothing for a year sound? No work, no emails, no career progression, no striving or achieving or being productive. For many of us, such a thought might once have brought its own anxiety attack – surely, work is status, earning money is achievement, and being busy is a brag? But these days, a year of nothing is more likely to sound dreamy, even aspirational – there has been, as they say, a vibe shift. </p>

                        <p>
                            MIAMI — An alarming change in the forecast now shows the potential for a dangerous hurricane to strike the west coast of Florida during the workweek with damaging winds, life-threatening storm surge and torrential rain.

The budding cyclone was designated Tropical Storm Milton on Saturday afternoon by the National Hurricane Center, but it's now expected to rapidly intensify into a hurricane by Monday and reach Florida on Wednesday.
